## 🔧 About the Engine

### 🔗 Original Ymir Engine Repository: [Ymir Engine](https://github.com/francesctr4/Ymir-Engine)  

**Ymir Engine** is a custom game engine built from scratch in C++ using **SDL** and **OpenGL** for graphics and system management. It was developed as part of the *Game Engines* subject during the third year of the **Videogame Design and Development** degree at **CITM UPC (Terrassa)**, supervised by [Miquel Suau](https://github.com/MayKoder).

Its primary goal is to provide a clean and educational architecture for understanding how real-world game engines work — from low-level rendering to high-level systems.

## 🎮 Developed Alongside: *Alien Extraction*

### 🔗 Original Alien Extraction Repository: [Alien Extraction](https://github.com/Clapcom-Studios/Alien-Extraction)  

While creating the game Alien Extraction, the engine evolved to support more advanced features and systems. Many high-level capabilities were added to meet the needs of the game, pushing the engine’s flexibility and potential.

This marked a turning point — **Ymir Engine** became something more powerful, more adaptable, and ready for future expansions.
