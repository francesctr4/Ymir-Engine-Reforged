## Description

Ymir Engine is part of the Game Engines subject, on the third year of the Videogame Design and Development degree, taught at CITM UPC (Terrassa) and supervised by [Miquel Suau](https://github.com/MayKoder).

The engine has been made from scratch in C++ using SDL and OpenGL to manage graphics. The main target of the project is to be able to integrate complex systems such as graphics management and game engine architecture in a simple and understandable way for educational purposes.

During the development of the game [Alien Extraction](https://github.com/Clapcom-Studios/Alien-Extraction), the engine was also being improved adding more high level systems, in order to be able to develop all the features required by the game.
